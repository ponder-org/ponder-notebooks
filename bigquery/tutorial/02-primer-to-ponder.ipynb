    "Ponder lets you run your pandas code directly in your data warehouse. This means that you can continue to write pandas, but with the scalability and security benefits of a modern data warehouse. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data science at all scales**: With Ponder's technology, the same pandas workflows can be run at all scales, from megabytes to terabytes, without changing a single line of code. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **No change to user workflow:** Data scientists can continue running their existing pandas workflows and writing pandas code in their favorite IDE of choice, and benefit from seamless scalability improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simplify your data infrastructure:** No need to set up and maintain compute infrastructure required for other parallel processing frameworks (e.g., Spark, Ray, Dask, etc.) to perform large scale data analysis with pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Guaranteed security:** All your pandas workflows will be executed in BigQuery, thus benefiting from the rigorous security guarantees offered by BigQuery."

Modin has more than 5M+ downloads to-date and is being adopted in leading data and AI teams. We built Modin and Ponder to address the scalability bottlenecks that practitioners face when using pandas (which is single-threaded and often leads to out-of-memory errors). But unlike other big data frameworks (e.g., Spark, SQL), we let you continue using the same pandas API and semantics, while doing the magic behind the scenes to let you scale on hundreds of GB up to terabytes of data."

It does this by translating your pandas queries to corresponding SQL queries to run on your data warehouse. Ponder gives you the flexibility of working in pandas directly and often there are queries that are easier to write in pandas than having to craft hundreds of lines of SQL!\n",
